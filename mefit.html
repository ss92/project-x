                <h2>Project overview</h2>
                <p>With the internet and social media, we now have access to so much information, which sometimes leads to distractions and herd goals. We all want to try that cheese dripping pizza from that Instagram #foodporn post and still maintain that #fitspiration physique! We want to join that #5AMClub (this some!) and #party all night with friends!</p>
                <p>All of us want to become healthy and fit but we either do not get enough time or we lack the motivation to achieve this desire of ours.</p>
                <p>In this project, we explored how users lifestyle is affecting their fitness levels and how can we improve that.</p>
            
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Fun fact : Uganda and Finland are the world’s fittest countries. And for them, being fit isn’t the choice but a condition of necessity! They tend to integrate movement into their daily life and chores!</p>
                    <p>Not-so-fun fact : In 2016, around 13% of the world’s adult population were obese. And now, at the end of 2019 this has increased to 30% and counting.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Role</h2>
                <ul class="list__block">
                    <li>Product design, user research(Quantitative)</li>
                    <li>Divided into team of 5 that included people of different backgrounds like finance, engineering & management</li>
                    <li>Duration: 7 sessions (~5 hours each on weekends)</li>
                </ul>

                    <img src="./images/process.jpg" alt="">
                </div>

                <h2>The challenge</h2>
                <p>The fitness experience in today’s available solutions lacks a combination of motivation -> goal setting -> competing -> tracking</p>
                <p>Most of the solutions today either track your steps or train you for muscle builds or only make you aware of the diet plans that are available.</p>

                <h2>The solution</h2>
                <p>With meFit, we are aiming at combining all to provide a better experience to the user.</p>
                <p>For your fitness journey, you need self-regulated learning activities like setting goals, goal oriented diet plans and reviewing your day-to-day progress.</p>

                <h2>Discover</h2>
                <h4>Assumptions</h4>
                <p>We looked up on web and talked to people to get more knowledge about the fitness industry and what people are currently doing to be fit. The finding are listed below:</p>
                <ul class="list__block">
                    <li>Fitness normally pertains to physical appearance.</li>
                    <li>People do not take stress/ depression/ anxiety seriously and mostly are not even aware.</li>
                    <li>People normally take fitness as either weight-loss or muscle-up.</li>
                    <li>People may not be aware of better lifestyle practices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>To validate these assumptions and to understand the idea of fitness for the users we went into the research phase.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <label>Online survey (Quantitative)</label>
                        <p>To have a better understanding of our target users habits and lifestyle. We were able to survey around 71 people to:</p>
                        <ul class="list__block">
                            <li>Learn about the user’s background; help in creating a customized solution.</li>
                            <li>Know more about that specific gender; how their habits are and how much time is devoted by them to health.</li>
                            <li>Understand the micro habits of the user related to his/her health.</li>
                            <li>Understand the current awareness of the user related to his/her health.</li>
                            <li>Understand the exact problem a user’s faces.</li>
                            <li>Understand how they currently tackle these problems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="list__block">
                            <li>About 80–90% people spend more than 2.5 hours in their office commute, thereby very little time for themselves.</li>
                            <li>People are somewhat aware of digital products available</li>
                            <li>People use various resources to keep a check on their health</li>

                <h4>Insights</h4>
                <p>We realized that some of our initial assumptions were correct. Some more details that we were able to figure through this survey:</p>

                <ul class="list__block">
                    <li>With regard to healthy habits, people primarily focused on food habits and keeping themselves active.</li>
                    <li>Users faced health issues like back pain, weight gain, etc and mostly they used home remedies or changes in their lifestyle.</li>
                    <li>Also, we found out that most of the users still have issues in finding time for their health.</li>
                    <li>Most users didn’t read anything on the internet, so there was a lack of awareness.</li>
                    <li>To manage the stress they did whatever that made them happy like cooking, listening to music, or playing games.</li>
                    <li>The most common challenges faced by the users was related to their weight and having low stamina. They ate healthy food and did some sort of physical activity, workout or exercise to tackle issues faced by them</li>

                        <p>We are starting with predefined goals for now and these goals can be tracked easily by the activity tracker and users can see their progress themselves. The user can view their steps walked, calories intake and the distance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.</p>
                        <p>They will get their diet and exercise routine set according to their goal.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <label>Exercise</label>
                        <p>This 5–10 minutes exercise part is the result of limited time available to the user. The user is presented with carefully catalogued set of exercises that are short and targeted to a particular body part.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="./images/Exercise.jpg" alt="">

                    <li>
                        <label>Diet</label>
                        <p>Recipes are Categorized by meals and with appropriate filters. User can choose from a available list of filters like: high calorie, high protein, calorie cautious, home-style, etc according to his/her requirement.</p>
                        <p>Veg/Non-veg with time and approx Calories are also mentioned for a better decision making.</p>
                        <p>Also, user would be able to see Goal oriented recipes once it is set.</p>

                    <li>
                        <label>Barcode Scanner</label>
                        <p>The barcode scanner lets the users scan the barcode of any packed item and tell the user various nutrients and minerals, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, etc. available in the product.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="./images/Scan.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>

                </ol>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>The intended scope versus the real project scope: importance to have a focal point to start</p>
                <p>Think big, but start small and focused, and expand the use cases based on the track. It will enable more efficient project management as well as more scalable design solutions. The initiation for this project is to explore design opportunities for an effective digital health product, but this intended scope is obviously too big to be executable.</p>
                <p>When we started mental + physical health was our focus. But, down the line it was not possible to do justice to both.</p>
                <p>I and my team mates did have some interesting thoughts on that too and will try to implement those.</p>

                <div class="list">
                    <label>Future Scope</label>
                    <ul class="list__block">
                        <li>To be able to add custom goals</li>
                        <li>Calendar tracking for exercise part</li>
                        <li>To ab able to add scanned barcode directly to goal diet plan</li>
                        <li>Meditation and yoga is to be included</li>
                        <li>Competitive behavior and adding friends</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                

                <p>And lastly I would like to thank each of my team mates for being the awesome people one could have.</p>
